"""Validate the dev-harness doc layer without external packages.


@impl DOB-001

Five mechanical doc-layer rules plus one backlog navigation rule:

1. ADR index <-> directory consistency: every ``NNNN-*.md`` in
   ``deep_research_harness/docs/adr/`` (excluding ``README.md``) is listed in the
   index table, and every ADR listed in the index exists on disk.
2. Relative links resolve: every relative Markdown link in the entry-chain
   documents and in the docs-layer documents points to an existing file.
   ``http(s)``, ``mailto:``, bare ``#anchor``, and angle-bracket targets are
   ignored.
3. Entry-chain and docs-layer documents are UTF-8 and end with a trailing newline.
4. Docs-layer scope completeness: every Markdown document actually present under
   ``deep_research_harness/docs/`` is registered in ``DOC_LAYER_DOCS``, so coverage
   cannot silently shrink when new documents are added. Registered but absent
   documents are reported by rules 2 and 3 instead.
5. Backlog ``_`` convention: every ``_``-prefixed directory that exists under
   ``_backlog/`` is declared in ``BACKLOG_UNDERSCORE_DIRS``, every declared
   directory exists, and each declared name is documented in ``_backlog/README.md``.
   This keeps the ``_`` prefix meaning "retained collection, not the active work
   queue" instead of drifting back into "actively edited but hidden".
6. Entry-chain character budgets: each resident document listed in
   ``DOC_BUDGETS`` must not exceed its character ceiling. Counts are characters,
   not words: ``wc -w``-style counting treats CJK text as one word per run and
   would be loose by an order of magnitude. Budgets apply only to listed files —
   routed-to documents are deliberately unbudgeted. Ceilings ratchet down:
   lowering one is always allowed; raising one requires a one-line justification
   recorded next to the entry.

A docs-layer document is a Markdown document under ``deep_research_harness/docs/``
— the top-level ``docs/*.md`` documents, plus any sublayer the enumeration
declares (operator runbooks, frozen evidence, decision records). Non-Markdown
files under that tree are out of scope. The scope is an explicit enumeration:
adding a docs document without registering it here turns rule 4 red on the next
run.

This checker is self-contained and standalone: it is NOT aggregated into
``check_project_gate.py`` (PRS-009 owns the six-component closeout) and is NOT
wired into the Harness ``make verify`` gate, which stays application-independent.
