# OpenSpec Governance

OpenSpec Governance turns agreed product decisions into reviewable, implementable
changes. It guides change work without becoming a runtime controller.

## Language

**Change**:
A bounded, reviewable proposal for a pending observable behavior or structural decision.
_Avoid_: a runtime instruction, an implementation branch

**Change Author**:
The contributor responsible for stating a change's scope, owner, evidence, and
non-goals before implementation begins.
_Avoid_: runtime authority, product user

**Required Behavior**:
An observable product or system outcome approved in an owning specification.
_Avoid_: a guide recommendation, an unverified implementation detail

**Change Guidance Route**:
The canonical route from a proposed Deep Research change to every relevant, actually
triggered design or admission policy and its owning contract. A change still has one
primary causal owner.
_Avoid_: project manual, runtime controller

**Cross-Cutting Review Guidance**:
Design guidance in the unified policy library that the Change Guidance Route routes alongside
its other policies while behavior remains owned by capability specifications and
runtime authorities.
_Avoid_: runtime guardrail, permission, approval

**Selected Change Closeout Evidence**:
Bounded evidence about one explicitly declared committed change range and its
non-authoritative review disposition.
_Avoid_: semantic clearance, archive authority, task ledger
