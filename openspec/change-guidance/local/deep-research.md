# Deep Research Local Composition

> authority: guidance only; product facts, behavior, and exact paths remain with their owners
> trigger: selecting a local module, Deep Research seam, Program, operation, information map, or local attention budget

Use this document for Deep Research module routing, Program admission, information
map, and local operation bindings. Other projects replace it with their own local
composition without changing portable core or profiles.

## Context Expansion Gate

A possible future use is not enough to expand scope.

## Context And Seams

A possible future use is not enough to expand scope. Start from `domain/` for typed
meaning, `engine/` for deterministic policy, `agents/` for model-facing cognition,
`graph/` for composition/routes, and `runtime/` for DeerFlow binding/I/O/persistence.

- **cognitive-program:** capability/prompt/context/feedback.
- **deterministic-guardrail:** typed parser/evaluator/gate after cognition is considered
  for a model-bearing symptom and does not fabricate a prompt obligation.
- **human-decision:** semantic subject/input/graph authority.
- **wiring:** composition or adapter; inspect cognition only when model-visible behavior changes.

## Program Focus

Program form: `## Program Focus` with at least two registered workstreams replaces the ordinary card.
Freeze budget, order, archive invariant, recovery, and exclusions; each workstream
retains owner, IDs, target/retirement, surface, policies, negative path, and reviews.
Failed work stays active; no partial archive. Selected control-placement changes retain
plan-review and archive-closeout-review as ordinary tasks. Operation guidance and
caller-declared closeout claims remain advisory; evidence that a registered runner
produced for a declared lane is what a gate may verify.

## Delivery Lanes

Harness-owned lanes live in `deep_research_harness/proof-lanes.toml`; `make proof LANE=<lane>`
records a receipt for one and `make proof-status` reports what went stale. Governance checks
are governance-owned and are not harness lanes.

| Surface | Harness lane (receipt-backed) |
| --- | --- |
| Application behavior, typed contracts, gates | `make verify` (`UV_OFFLINE=1`) |
| Interactive TUI and the debugger workbench | `make debugger-proof` |
| Guards that must be able to fail | `make mutation-check` |

| Governance check (not a harness lane) | Command |
| --- | --- |
| Published docs and guidance | `python3 openspec/governance/check_doc_hygiene.py` |
| Design, admission, and closeout receipts | `python3 openspec/governance/check_project_gate.py --phase closeout` |

Escalate to a human only for product direction or scope, reserved areas
(`.agents/skills/`, `.env`, gitignored local conveniences), irreversible or
out-of-bounds actions, spec-semantics adjudication, or an explicit review request.

## Information Map

Coding guidance selects the smallest spec/source/test seam; human README routes product
use; `openspec/config.yaml` routes authoring; `product/README.md` routes product
questions; the project-structure manifest (`project-structure.toml` contract +
`required-paths.toml` inventory) alone enumerates exact structure. Keep detailed
reader roles and line budgets here, while current facts and behavior remain in owners.

## Reader Roles

| Surface | Primary reader | Job |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `deep_research_harness/AGENTS.md` | Coding agent | Select the smallest application seam |
| `deep_research_harness/README.md` | Human/operator | Product and quick-start orientation |
| `deep_research_harness/docs/README.md` | Human/operator | Focused runtime, operations, and testing routes |
| `runtime-architecture.md` | Human/operator | Runtime and authority boundaries |
| `local-operations.md` | Operator | Commands and retained sessions |
| `testing-and-evaluation.md` | Contributor/operator | Test and evaluation evidence |
| `openspec/config.yaml` | OpenSpec author | Change authoring route |
| `openspec/product/README.md` | Human/Coding agent | Deep Research-specific orientation |

## Line Budgets

The checker uses line count as an attention signal, not a word-count quota.

| Surface | Warning | Hard failure |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| `deep_research_harness/AGENTS.md` | 120 lines | more than 160 lines |
| `deep_research_harness/CLAUDE.md` | 10 lines | more than 12 lines |
| `openspec/config.yaml` | 140 lines | more than 180 lines |
| `openspec/product/README.md` | 60 lines | more than 80 lines |
