# Core Change Practice

> authority: guidance only; owning specifications and executable contracts define behavior
> trigger: change admission, context selection, authority, and projections

## Principles

1. Start from the smallest owner of the changed semantic decision.
2. Admit an adjacent contract only with the concrete question it must answer.
3. Keep fact authority distinct from writers, projections, summaries, and diagnostics.
4. Select every policy whose trigger applies; one policy cannot waive another.
5. Match evidence to the changed decision and include the material negative path.
6. Give migration, recovery, retirement, and deletion a terminal invariant.
7. Make evidence newer than the change it claims, and let a runner write it.
8. Prove operator-facing behavior as a journey, and prove each guard can fail.

Guidance and review records never grant runtime behavior, state writes, routes,
permissions, tools, retries, or native workflow transitions.

## Change Admission

Name one primary causal owner, the question being answered, necessary adjacent
contracts, the lowest responsible evidence seam, exclusions, and every triggered
policy. A possible future use or general orientation does not admit another boundary.
Observable behavior belongs in its owning specification. A recurring question with a
specific trigger may become focused guidance; an operational procedure cannot
substitute for required behavior.

Use a planted invalid input for a deterministic validator and the narrowest real
handoff for a cross-boundary fact. A failed migration stays active for repair,
rollback, or explicit re-scope; it never silently narrows the approved outcome.

**Implementation artifacts sequence and verify; they never redesign.** Design and
tasks order files, symbols, and verification only. Design decisions belong to the
owning spec/delta and the change's design document; when implementation discovers a
decision the artifacts did not make, record it in the change's Deviation Register
with its ruling basis and landing place instead of quietly deciding in an
implementation file. An empty register states `none: <rationale>` explicitly.

## Four Kinds Of Claims

Label every upstream or imported-corpus conclusion with its claim kind: runtime
fact (verifiable against a pinned version), upstream requirement (governs
contributions to that upstream repo only), application-repo recommendation (this
project's synthesis), or repo-local decision (owned here). Upstream governance
items are always cited as "上游参考" — they never impersonate this repository's
requirements, and the citation carries the pinned version it was verified against.

## Decision Records And Supersession

A change's design document carries an `## Alternatives` section whenever real
alternatives were considered and rejected: each rejected alternative appears with the
reason it lost. When none existed, the section states `none: <rationale>` explicitly.
This section is the process-layer home for negative knowledge — it travels with the
change and lands in the archive, so a later session reads the rejection instead of
re-proposing it.

The exemption criterion: mechanical or local edits are exempt from decision records;
diff size is not an exemption reason — the absence of a durable tradeoff is. A local
fix does not qualify merely because its implementation is small, and a substantive
change does not qualify merely because it is large.

Supersession: reversing an earlier decision adds a new record that cross-links the old
one; it never rewrites the old record in place. Full replacement first absorbs every
unique rationale, alternative, consequence, and verification gap from the record it
replaces. Archived records are frozen snapshots — cite them as history, never as
current authority.

## Delivery Evidence

Evidence is only as good as its freshness: once the line, file, or surface changes,
earlier evidence is stale and proves nothing about the version being delivered.
Prefer evidence a runner produces - the command, its exit code, the revision, and a
digest of its own output - over anyone's summary of having run something.

Match the evidence to the surface. A deterministic owner takes a focused test; an
operator-facing surface takes at least one end-to-end journey (enter, act, observe,
recover or exit) beside its unit tests. A new guard is unproven until a recorded
mutation shows it failing when the guarded behavior is removed. State plainly what
could not be verified locally instead of passing over it quietly. At every slice's
close, run the tests and re-read the spec's review checklist before moving on —
the closeout reread is routine slice discipline, not a control-placement-only
obligation.

## Authority And Projections

Name the owner of every fact before adding a projection. Record who may propose a
write, which deterministic boundary admits it, and how conflict or absence is handled.
A model output, summary, journal, view, cache, or explanation cannot replace the owner
or decide a transition. If no owner exists, establish one through the owning contract
rather than inventing a receipt that makes uncertainty look complete.

## Context Selection

Start with the owning specification, closest implementation, and lowest responsible
evidence seam. Before opening an adjacent module or upstream source, name the
interface, authority, compatibility, or observed-failure question it must answer.
If local evidence still cannot identify an owner, clarify admission instead of
scanning unrelated code. When guidance text and code disagree, the code and its
tests win — guidance stays honest by routing to owners, not by outranking them.
